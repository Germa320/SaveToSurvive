# SaveToSurvive

Scripts for the game that supposed to be multi genre, level architecture based university project.
Ended up beinging unsfinished, without third point'n'click level and some fixes.

The concept of the game was that player has to finish 3 levels in order to escape the world he woke in.
Levels:
- first one - FPS level, inspired by SuperHot
- second one - RPG level, supposed to be inspired by Skyrim, but due to lack of time it became a firemaking simulator
- third one - as said before
- level zero - visual transition to each main level
